<h1> Project Plan Overview </h1>
<h3> Overview: Describe the overall goal of your project. </h3>
<p> In this project, we will be analyzing course and instructor information from course explorer for courses offered in the academic year 2025-26 in the college of LAS and the Gies College of Business. Members of our team belong to these two colleges and we want to better understand the course offerings and instructors within our departments <p>
<h3> Research Question(s): What is/are the question(s) you intend to address? </h3>
<p> Some research questions we want to address are: <p>
<ul> 
  <li> Can the enrollment information for various courses inform us about which courses are popular amongst students? </li>
  <li> Are there specific instructors who are popular amongst students?</li>



</ul>

<h3> Team: Clearly define team member roles and responsibilities </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Emma: Progress tracker, coder and reinforcer</li>
  <li> Rhea: Progress tracker, coder and reinforcer </li>
  Both of us will ensure that we are on track with the project timeline, are contributing to project objectives, and satisfying rubric requirements. In case any of us gets too busy or caught up with other tasks, we will support each other and ensure burden sharing 
</ul>



<h3> Datasets: Identify and describe the datasets that you will use.  </h3>

<h2> Timeline:  </h2>

<h3> Week 8 GOAL: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Data lifecycle (cf. Module 1)</li>
  <li> Ethical data handling (cf. Module 2) </li>
  <li>Data collection and acquisition (cf. Module 3)</li>
</ul>

Emma- Ethical data handling (cf. Module 2): Identification of all ethical, legal, or policy constraints and how they were addressed. This includes issues related to consent, privacy/confidentiality, copyright, licenses and terms of use

Rhea- Data collection and acquisition (cf. Module 3): Collection or acquisition of at least 2 different datasets from distinct trustworthy sources

Together- Data lifecycle (cf. Module 1): Relate your project to one or more of the lifecycle models discussed in class, review each other's work

</p>

<br />

<h3> Week 9 GOAL: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Storage and organization (cf. Modules 4-5)</li>
  <li> Extraction and enrichment (cf. Module 6) </li>
  <li> Data integration (cf. Module 7-8)</li>
</ul>

Emma- Extraction and enrichment (cf. Module 6) 

Rhea- Data integration (cf. Module 7-8): Integration of datasets (Python/Pandas or SQL)

Together- Storage and organization (cf. Modules 4-5): Select and describe a specific storage and organization strategy. This may include use of tabular, relational, or semi-structured models via filesystems or databases as well as filesystem structures and naming conventions, review each other's work

</p>

<br />

<h3> Week 10 GOAL: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Data quality (cf. Module 9) </li>
  <li> Data cleaning (cf. Module 10) </li>
  <li> Workflow automation and provenance (cf. Module 11-12) </li>
</ul>

Emma- Data quality (cf. Module 9): Document data quality assessment results. 

Rhea- Data cleaning (cf. Module 10): Describe any data cleaning methods applied (e.g., missing values, outliers, syntactic or semantic cleaning)

Together- Workflow automation and provenance (cf. Module 11-12): Provide an automated end-to-end workflow, review each other's work.

</p>

<br />

<h3> Week 11 GOAL: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Reproducibility and transparency (cf. Module 13) </li>
  <li> Metadata and data documentation (cf. Module 15) </li>
  <li> Create README file </li>
</ul>

Emma- Metadata and data documentation (cf. Module 15): Metadata and data documentation to support discovery, understandability, and reuse

Rhea- Reproducibility and transparency (cf. Module 13):  Your project must provide sufficient information to allow someone else to reproduce your workflow and analysis

Together- Create README file, review each other's work

</p>

<br />

<h3> Week 12 GOAL: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure all the expected artifacts are included in our project </li>
  <li> Make sure the project completes all the requirements </li>
</ul>

Emma- Make sure all the expected artifacts are included in our project

Rhea- Make sure the project completes all the requirements

Together- Review everything! 

</p>

<br />

<h3> Constraints: Describe any known constraints.</h3>
<p> Emma- The one constraint is how the modules might not be available for us when we want to complete the goals so we will just have to adjust as we go. </p>

<br />

<h3> Gaps: Identify any known gaps or areas where you need additional input.
 </h3>

<p> Rhea- Lack of a strong coding background and only an introductory knowledge of SQL will be a constraint and require additional work and input. Additionally, due to a heavy courseload this semester, several midterms and submission deadlines fall around the planned timeline so timeline revisions are to be expected and additional support will be needed </p>

<p> Emma- I agree with Rhea, I will need to be spending more time learning code because my coding background is not strong, so I will have to be dedicating more time to this project.  It will also be very busy during the end of the semester so hopefully I will be able to get all the goals done for the week, but we might have to adjust the schedule as we go and we might possibly have to adjust who completes what task. </p>
