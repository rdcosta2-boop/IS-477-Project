<h1> Project Plan Overview </h1>
<h3> Overview: Describe the overall goal of your project. </h3>
<p> In this project, we will be analyzing course and instructor information from course explorer for courses offered in the academic year 2025-26 in the college of LAS and the Gies College of Business. Members of our team belong to these two colleges and we want to better understand the course offerings and instructors within our departments <p>
<h3> Research Question(s): What is/are the question(s) you intend to address? </h3>
<p> Some research questions we want to address are: <p>
<ul> 
  <li> Can the enrollment information for various courses inform us about which courses are popular amongst students? </li>
  <li> Are there specific instructors who are popular amongst students?</li>

</ul>

<h3> Team: Clearly define team member roles and responsibilities </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Emma: Emotional support? </li>
  <li> Rhea: Emotional support? </li>
</ul>

<h3> Datasets: Identify and describe the datasets that you will use.  </h3>

<h3> Constraints: Describe any known constraints.</h3>
<p> aaaaaaaaa </p>
<p> aaaaaaaaaa </p>

<h3> Gaps: Identify any known gaps or areas where you need additional input.
 </h3>

<p> Rhea-Lack of a strong coding background and only an introductory knowledge of SQL will be a constraint and require additional work and input. Additionally, due to a heavy courseload this semester, several midterms and submission deadlines fall around the planned timeline so timeline revisions are to be expected and additional support will be needed </p>
