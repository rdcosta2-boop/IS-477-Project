### An update on each of the tasks described on your project plan including references to specific artifacts in your repository (such as datasets, scripts, workflows, workflow diagrams, etc).
In total, we were able to complete these tasks:
<ul>
  <li> Data lifecycle (cf. Module 1)</li>
  <li> Ethical data handling (cf. Module 2) </li>
  <li> Data collection and acquisition (cf. Module 3)</li>
  <li> Data integration (cf. Module 7-8)</li>
</ul>

We also decided to use different datasets.  We decided to use historical stock market data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance and historical S&P 500 Index data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, only using the data from January 1, 2015 to October 25, 2025 in 3 month intervals.

### An updated timeline indicating the status of each task and when they will be completed.
We still need to complete:
<ul>
  <li> Storage and organization (cf. Modules 4-5)</li>
  <li> Extraction and enrichment (cf. Module 6) </li>
  <li> Data quality (cf. Module 9) </li>
  <li> Data cleaning (cf. Module 10) </li>
  <li> Workflow automation and provenance (cf. Module 11-12) </li>
  <li> Reproducibility and transparency (cf. Module 13) </li>
  <li> Metadata and data documentation (cf. Module 15) </li>
  <li> Create README file </li>
</ul>

### UPDATED TIMELINE

Emma:
From here until the due date, I will complete the following based on our Project Plan:

<li> Storage and organization (cf. Modules 4-5)</li>
<li> Data quality (cf. Module 9) </li>
<li> Metadata and data documentation (cf. Module 15) </li>
<li> Help create the README file </li>









### A description of any changes to your project plan itself, in particular about your progress so far. Also include changes you made to your plan based on feedback you may have received for Milestone 2.
*Each team member has to write a short summary of their contributions to the current milestone. Each team member should add and commit their contribution summary themselves to the shared github repo.*

Emma: We made some changes to the project plan.  As discussed earlier, we changed our datasets to the ones mentioned above.  I contributed doing Data lifecycle (cf. Module 1), Ethical data handling (cf. Module 2), Data collection and acquisition (cf. Module 3), and Data Integration (cf. Module 7-8).  

#### Changes we made based on the feedback

The feedback we recieved said, "The stated project goal describes the assignment, but doesn't provide context for the research question. In your progress report, expand your project goal to explain the context of your proposed work (i.e., why are you interested in the specific research question? How do the datasets help you address the question?)"

In response to this feedback, we have decided to change our datasets.  Our research questions are ______________ and _____________
